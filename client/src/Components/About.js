          <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mt-20'>Our <span className='text-green-400'>Mission</span></h1>
          <h5 className='mt-8 font-normal mr-14'>At Ecohack, our mission is simple yet impactful: to create a world where no one goes to bed hungry. We strive to minimize food waste by facilitating the seamless donation of excess food from restaurants to NGOs, who, in turn, distribute it to individuals and families facing food insecurity.</h5>

          <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mt-20'>How It <span className='text-green-400'>Works</span></h1>
          <h5 className='mt-8 font-normal mr-14'>Restaurants on our platform can easily input the quantity of surplus food they have, and NGOs can efficiently coordinate the collection and distribution process. This streamlined approach ensures that perfectly good food doesn't go to waste and reaches those who need it most.</h5>
